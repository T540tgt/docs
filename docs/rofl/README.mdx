# Build ROFL Application

Runtime OFf-chain Logic (ROFL) applications are a mechanism to augment the
deterministic on-chain backend with verifiable off-chain applications. These
applications are stateless, have access to the network and can perform expensive
and/or non-deterministic computation.

ROFL applications run in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), similar to the
on-chain confidential runtimes. This enables them to securely authenticate to
the on-chain backend which is handled transparently by the framework. Together
they allow one to implement secure decentralized oracles, bridges, AI agents and
more.

This chapter will teach you how to build your own ROFL application with
[Oasis Runtime SDK].
